# Overview for libdrew
Libdrew is intended to be a front-end for both OpenGL and Vulkan (when the spec is released). It uses OOP to encapsulate OpenGL constructs. When adding Vulkan support, many of the constructs will be simplified, but this library will allow support across OpenGL and Vulkan, so it will still need to encorporate OpenGL concepts.
